### Document Management System

Create, edit and view documents.

The DMS helps you create Documents and view them based on priviledges the user has been given. There are 3 roles allowed: Admin, contributor and viewer.
Each document has an access level based on these 3 roles. Documents can be categorised by type.
The documents created can be shared via facebook and google plus.
